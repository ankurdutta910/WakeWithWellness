      <h6 style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>DECODING MENTAL HEALTH: THE PANDEMIC VERSION <span style={{fontStyle: 'italic', color: 'red', fontSize: '13px'}}>(1st Position)</span></h6>
      <p>The coronavirus pandemic unleashed extraordinary ways of life on every person on this globe. With an entirely new disease 
        unheard of, came a string of unpredictable events that disrupted every activity of human civilization till date; barely an 
        aspect untouched by the pandemic waves. With so much happening at a quick pace, the world outside the human body came to a 
        sudden standstill. But the human mind did not. It began witnessing an assortment of complex emotions- both existent and 
        emerging. These were inescapable states of mind making no person exceptions to mental health imbalances.<br></br><br></br>
  
  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Realising the Value</span><br></br>

  Mental health is a matter of paramount significance. This subject in human health discourses has often been on the underestimated, neglected and ignorant side where people forget to take care of the very engine that drives the body to any movement. Everything that we as human beings experience in our day to day lives has an influence- negatively as well as positively on our cognitive processes and functions. This hub of masterly operations takes responsibility for receiving, extracting, deciphering and responding to every stimulus the body is exposed to. The brain engineers the mind, controlling the body, which is otherwise mere skin. When vital cognitions fail, the mind goes astray followed by mental breakdowns and malfunctions, causing the body to behave in the most bizarre and dangerous ways. Yet, the importance of mental health is meagre.<br></br><br></br>
  
  People are always keen on doing the maximum and spending the best on everything that keeps their bodies distant from diseases and deficiencies; ensuring hygienic environments for cooking, eating and storing, maintaining clean homes and surroundings, and going the extra mile on additional intake of nutritional supplements separately. But for the health-supporting mentally, the pivot of all bodily functions, the count stands at little to nothing.<br></br><br></br>

  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Mental Health and Pandemic: Hand in Hand</span><br></br>

  The Covid-19 pandemic has paved paths for infinite problems. The world is in shock and suffering. Humans are not only contracting the coronavirus but have also found themselves in fear, anxiety, stress, trauma, disorders and depression. For people who test positive with the contagion, dreadful times burden them in hospitals. Whereas, people staying at home are strained with new realities like total confinement, work from home, online classes and harsh ones like cuts in salaries, job losses and dropouts. Also, not leaving out fake news, rumours and excessive exaggerations being circulated through various media. All these are new and difficult adaptations. Thus, both physical and mental exhaustion prevail. Every person, if not infected by the virus, have experienced mental issues at some point or the other, as life sets adrift from normalcy.<br></br><br></br>
  
  Circumstances as such make people aware, acknowledge and assess their mental health state. It is evident how a physical ailment can emanate other ailments as well. Mental health is sensitive and fragile to stimuli propelling negative emotions, just like the physical body is acute to pathogens. Numerous courses, webinars, workshops and therapies related to mental healthcare are being organized more than ever before. For decades, the prevalence of mental health conditions has been broadly unchanged; this trend changed in 2020 with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic (2020, OECD). Hence, a genuine demand for mental health resources is at rise as people struggle every day.<br></br><br></br>
  

  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Mental Health and Pandemic: Hand in Hand</span><br></br>
  As days passed and lockdowns extended, staying at home became more troublesome. Different age groups experienced different issues to cope with. They are still being confronted in the present day.<br></br><br></br>

  At an age when children should be full of energy, socially active and spirited, they appear withdrawn. Children are now locked in their homes due to school closures having very little room for interaction with their fellow friends. Physical activities are compromised. As a result, they are experiencing loneliness, lack of companionship, boredom, irritation and sadness. During such times, they also fear separation from their parents and loved ones on whom they depend entirely. Children have become restless due to lack of outdoor activities and interactions which they were always accustomed to. In a report, findings reveal that children have felt uncertainty, isolation, poor appetite, agitation, inattention and separation-related anxiety. (2020, PubMed)<br></br><br></br>
  
  Adolescents are facing frequent and enormous emotional instability during the pandemic. Already in an age group, where they pass from numerous physical, hormonal and emotional transitions, the pandemic exerts greater changes on them. Many important settings like classrooms, seminars, competitions and other gatherings have gone virtual. The role of social media platforms is now even more prominent. Young teenagers are burdened with daily flushes of information, academic routines, social isolation, extra-curricular courses followed by mood and eating disorders, panic attacks, persistent stress of a busier life existing virtually, anxiety over balancing every task as a student, inferiority complexes from social media platforms depicting perfection and others. Students have also been anxious over the cancellation of examinations and other disruptions in their educational fields (2020, PubMed). Number of cases with depression, disorders and suicides have shot up. The mental health of adolescents is seriously severed accruing to all the newness.<br></br><br></br>
  
  The mental health status has also taken an unhealthy leap for adults. They are the victims of unemployment and pay cuts. Adults who have lost their jobs are going through heavy mental stress. They are in a very tough position due to financial insecurity which has affected them and also their families. A report by Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) has proved that people who lost their jobs during the pandemic reported greater incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders than those who still had their jobs. Others who are fortunate to retain their jobs with certain pay cuts have been introduced to ‘work from home’. While these have been convenient from home desks, they are also challenging because the division of workplace and household tasks are now converged. Spending hours in front of screens and also making sure household chores are properly done simultaneously creates a pressure of balance between the two. Mostly, women have endured the brunt of this challenge, both working and non-working.<br></br><br></br>
  
  The last age group which has also faced mental health issues are the elderly people. Senior citizens have also suffered from the inability to step outside. At such ages of physical and mental weakness, new rules and health protocols are difficult to process and follow. They depend majorly on external support and require communication. The pandemic has disturbed their social connections with selected family members and friends due to lack of physical contact, they worry about their existing health problems, their medications and treatments along with increased fears of illness and death. Such a period has made them more vulnerable to helplessness.<br></br><br></br>
  
  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>The Warriors and Grievers</span><br></br> 
  It will be unfair to sideline the mental health conditions of frontline workers who are ensuring the safety of every person, people who are infected with the virus and families of the covid infected patients. Doctors, nurses, medical associates and healthcare workers are drained physically and mentally because of their uninterrupted pursuit of duty. Many have even lost their lives due to the virus, overwork and absence of proper rest. Patients of Covid-19 continuously worry over their speedy recovery. Their families also go through the mental distress of fear and anxiety.<br></br><br></br>
  
  
  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Prioritizing Mental Health</span><br></br>  
  Before the global disease struck, only a section of people prioritized their mental health. Mental health centres, helplines and related assistance operated minimally in countries. Instances of underfunding and zero funding of these provisions were also prominent. With the advent of the virus, these loopholes widened. Although the demand for mental health services expanded, their initial availability and accessibility were not enough. Only with time, has mental health support increased at an impressive pace. During this health crisis, people should indulge in healthy habits that build self-realisation and stay away from any information or habits harming their positive energies and beliefs. Focus should be on the good of oneself as well as others. If professional psychological intervention is required, one must not hesitate to get help. The gravity of mental illnesses and their effects needs to be emphasised. They are not simple or silly. They are indeed as serious as any other physical problem. In light of the pandemic, governments can also play their part in spreading mental health awareness. Just like mandatory basic covid protocols are imparted through various media and communication networks, the same can be done for accentuating mental health advices and details. Thus, dealing with mental wellness as eagerly as with physical. This can produce substantial impacts in a positive direction.<br></br><br></br>
  
  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Summing up</span><br></br>  
  The essence of achieving a healthy body will be complete only if one equally prioritises mental and physical health components. All research, findings and practical experiences support the affirmation and adoption mental health awareness. The pandemic is an eye-opener to stereotypes, stigmas and taboos related to mental health. Let us be wise in disseminating the term health in ‘Health is Wealth’. One who embraces good health, nurtures both body and mind.<br></br><br></br>

      <p>Here’s a quick story of my father battling Covid, before I begin talking about Mental Health. I do not know how short it’s gonna be, but I’m gonna keep it as crisp as possible.
       <br></br><br></br>

       On 10th Oct, 2020 my father was tested positive for Covid-19. It wasn’t as severe as we have seen others suffer so we decided to keep him in isolation in our guest room. As my mother is a Nurse who actively worked on and off on many covid cases, she knew all the procedures required to make anyone feel better. And at that time the vaccines weren't ready yet, so hospitals used the usual medicines for treatment. My father is a very stubborn person by nature, he didn’t want to stay in the hospital ward. So we all collectively decided to keep him home, isolated. Also home quarantine was something many infected people opted for. After a couple of days his body temperature started rising, we fed him the medicines as prescribed and even injected a bottle of saline at midnight at home. On the very next day, his health started deteriorating. We immediately rushed him to the hospital where my mother works, Central Hospital Maligaon, Guwahati. Fortunately due to having connections with the senior doctors at the hospital my father was immediately rushed to the ICU. He was under observation for 24 hours. But the next day one of the doctors who was working in Covid Ward referred my father to GNRC Medical, Amingaon. Stating that it will be quite risky to keep him here for long.<br></br><br></br>
  
       I was there with my mother when he was being shifted to a different hospital. We immediately rushed him to GNRC, in an ambulance. It was my first time stepping inside an ambulance. It’s frightening and scary. My father sat right in front of me with an oxygen mask up on his face. At that moment inside the ambulance I heard nothing but the siren of the ambulance. When the ambulance rushes through chaotic and busy streets, the eyes of pedestrians are on you. I do not remember how I felt at that moment or did I even feel anything? My brain blocked all the emotions and tapped out only the adrenaline. I carried all the essentials and documentation required for the admission with me all the time. I was making calls to my relatives and father’s colleagues, informing them about us being at the hospital. After all the hassle he was finally shifted inside and his treatment began. My body began to ache, I was tired and drenched in sweat. As we had to walk up and down to the 5th floor several times.<br></br><br></br>

       One of my aunts called me, when I received the call; I wasn’t able to even utter a single word. I immediately passed my phone to my mother and let her do the talking. Until then I was so busy in fulfilling all the necessities of the hospital required to begin the treatment, I didn't knew what would happen if something went wrong. Suddenly my mind hit me with the thought of living a life ahead without a father. And that’s when the first tear rolled down my cheeks. It took me a while to calm myself down. After a couple of hours one of my cousins showed up at the hospital to be there with us. My mother and cousin decided to stay overnight at the hospital. I returned back home. I freshened myself and immediately laid down on my bed. The relief, stress and tiredness flooded inside, disappeared. After many days of treatment he was tested negative, but they didn’t discharge him for another 3 days. Then he returned home after triumphing covid. It’s been almost 8 months and he is making progress to normal after suffering from post covid complications.<br></br><br></br>


  <span style={{fontWeight: '600', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>My thoughts on Mental Health during Pandemic</span><br></br>

  Waking up in total oblivion isn’t a possibility anymore. We’re flooded by the evil tidings. My mind takes endless runs trying to scream and escape the chaos inside. We are all drowning into the ocean of loss, grief and despair. Unable to fathom the grasp of the situation. The stigma of anxiety and apprehension has always been a part throughout my whole childhood. And during this time of crisis, the levels have only peaked. Failing to express myself from beneath got nothing but vague acknowledgement from others. To the point where I start questioning my own sanity, doubting my beliefs and trying to make sense from the most nonsensical occurrences in the surroundings.
  <br></br><br></br>
We all lost someone; a guardian, a friend, a neighbour and an acquaintance. Witnessing them turn cold in front of our eyes rushed an immense amount of emotions and feelings inside us. To the point where due to the extremely hectic arrangement of cremation or burying, we couldn’t even bid a farewell to them or get a glance through their lifeless faces. Due to the constraints and orders from the authorities, it is quite burdensome to meet someone physically. Especially in these times when you need a shoulder to cry upon, a hug to loose upon and a hand to hold on.
<br></br><br></br>
Who do we blame for the loss? What could I’ve done? How long will I need to bear this?These are some of the questions that I've been trying to find answers to. Little did I know, chasing the retort gave nothing but more anger, more instability and insaneness. Living within the four walls for so long, craving for human interaction, suffocating in the chaos, unable to cope with loss and grief made me impatient and restless. I avoided any human contact physically and mentally. The endless scrolling of aimless social media consumed the little leftover inside me.
<br></br><br></br>
Fortunately, due to the existence of few people in my life. It wasn't as tough for me as others. As I do not seek any answers anymore. I want someone to just listen and give me the genuine and worthy validation that I want. Before soliciting solutions, the questions need to be addressed first in any circumstances. Writing has immensely helped me to declutter my mind and understand my thought process. This year I started blogging. And I can proudly say that I made some progress, it’s definitely minimal. But, I made it till here. I would like to shamelessly share a few of my small achievements. Published one of my articles on The Assam Tribune and even participated in a writing competition organised by VIT. Now, I have realized; life is a sequence of parables. At one point you’ll be at the deepest trench but the future definitely seems golden. So, just hang on.

      <p>Here’s a quick story of my father battling Covid, before I begin talking about Mental Health. I do not know how short it’s gonna be, but I’m gonna keep it as crisp as possible.
       <br></br><br></br>
<span style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>“MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A DESTINATION BUT A PROCESS IT’S ABOUT HOW YOU DRIVE, NOT WHERE YOU ARE GOING.”</span>   <br></br><br></br>

Mental health – a topic which does not get talked about as often as is needed these days. This concept is still vague for a lot of people even in 2021, an illness because of which people are taking their own lives. The reason for this may be because of the deep rooted stigma of the society that our mental health is not as important as our physical health; seeing is believing, what people cannot see, they tend to not believe that it exists. No one ever feels the need to talk about mental health, “it does not exist”, “i never thought you were so weak”, “you are overthinking”, “it’s not like that” are some of the common dialogues which we have to hear. But people need to realize that our brain, which is the most important organ of our body also needs rest, it needs frequent breaks, it needs to be taken care of the most.
<br></br><br></br>
According to a report in google, 46% of the people who commit suicide every year has been suffering mentally and this number is increasng day by day. This phenomenon is occuring worldwide so we cannot limit the consequences to only one country or blame a specific group. It’s a concept which is familiar to all irrespective of age groups but no one is willing to talk about it because of the fear
<br></br><br></br>
Of being shamed or being called a lunatic. However, even if a few people do understand the situation, they will give solutions to seek help or to consult a psychiatrist. But most of the times it does not work because the person going through problems already knows that something is not right with them and they need to go for therapy but they cannot because they either fear what the society will think or they are not ready for it.
<br></br><br></br>
The covid19 pandemic has made it worse for people who were already suffering from mental health related issues. Staying cooped up in one house with all the family members for almost a year has not been easy for most people. True, they can be considered lucky as compared to the people fighting the virus but not everyone has a loving or supportive family and that has made matters worse. Domestic violence and sexual harrasment cases has increased tenfold during this period and the ignorance of the society during such cases has not done anything to help. People find it hard to express themselves because they will be considered as vulnerable and weak or in some cases as seeking unnecessary attention. Speaking from personal experience, my aunt’s entire family was infected with the virus and her eldest son also went through mental trauma which resulted in him being hospitalized. My cousin could not understand the situation and commented that she never thought he could be so weak. Just because a person does not show does not mean it is not there, he/she may be suffering internally and the people around him would not have a single clue, he/she could be intending self harm and no one would even know. And when we keep bottling things up, there may come a point when our emotions will be at the peak and we will burst out which may harm us more.
<br></br><br></br>
Our schools and colleges have contributed a lot in encouraging mental health issues. Coming from a ba student who spent her entire 2nd and 3rd semesters in online classes, this mode of teaching has caused a lot of health related problems (both physical and mental), the latter would not have been a severe case if the teachers would have been more understanding and less dominating or demanding. I have had teachers saying we can go to them if we face any problems, yet at the same time they would not stop spreading negativity, calling us lazy and uncultured and also burdening us with assignments and tests with no regard for our well being. In some cases, i have also seen a few cases where the teacher would ask the student to postpone her medical (blood) test only because she gave a test of 20 marks to be submitted within 45 minutes. All this takes a severe toll on the student. True, in some cases, the teachers may also be suffering but they do need to realize that we are all in this together and we need to help and support each other instead of simply spreading negativity or taking our anger out on people whom we consider to be weaker than us.
<br></br><br></br>
Mental health has no regards for our wealth and power; a person who has everything can also be suffering in silence. We never know the inner battles which people have to fight for themselves and many a times if we get to know about them, we tend to ignore or ask them to stop acting like a kid and grow up. People need to realize that anyone, literally anyone regardless Of age, gender, profession, net worth can go through this phrase. The best people can do is to be kind and not spread unnecessary hate. Even if they do not understand what the other person is going through, it is important to ensure that we do not guilt trip the other person into thinking that what they are going through is unusual or cannot be treated. Gaslighting or not letting other people express their opinions freely can also result in mental trauma. In such cases, it is
<br></br><br></br>
Necessary to seek help from trusted people. Therapy should be sought by everyone even if they believe that nothing has happened to them, because trust me, everyone is suffering internally and needs help. Also try to be a good listener and always be kind to others; kindness costs nothing.

      দীঘদিনীয়া বৃক্কৰ বিকল হোৱা ৰোগীসকলৰ ক্ষেত্ৰত সফল বৃক্ক সংস্থাপনেই উত্তম মাধ্যম। সকলো 
        ৰোগীৰ বৃক্ক সংস্থাপনৰ বাবে উপযুক্ত নহ'ব পাৰে। বৃক্ক সংস্থাপনৰ বাবে চিকিৎসকে কিছুমান যাৱতীয় পৰীক্ষা নিৰীক্ষা কৰি ৰোগীৰ বৃক্ক সংস্থাপন উপযুক্ততাৰ

    description: <div class="container" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}><p>Sumi gasped for breath as she gulped the water down her throat. The chilled air conditioned room and a cool dawn couldn't halt her generously forging sweat. As she recalled her dreaded nightmare, she dwelt in actuality, hoping to broaden the thin line of divide between her dream and reality. Swallowing down her hypertension pill, she had a clash of thoughts between overwhelming hopelessness illuminated by her nightmare and a tinge of hope from the will to bring a change which was interrupted by the ring of her phone. She quickly gathered herself and answered the call- “Hello, Dr. Sumi here.” a few seconds of silence which was broken by a ‘ yes I will rush’.</p><br></br>
    <p>Driving amidst the dark with the tiny beam of the car’s fog lights guiding the way, Sumi again drowned in her pool of thoughts. The silhouettes rushing, commotion of ambulance’s sirens, cries of toddlers and screams of men and women over dead bodies from her dream again started to haunt her. As she drove across a police checkpoint, a policeman shoved his hands gesturing her to stop. Sumi immediately showed her Doctor’s ID to which the policeman greeted with folded hands and a slight bow, motioning her to drive off. Sumi felt a sudden surge of energy within herself. The small gesture from the policeman suddenly ignited the flame of hope which was about to die from the ghastly rushing wind of fear within her. It was as if that small gesture acted as a beam of guiding light amidst all the darkness around.</p><br></br>
    <p>Sumi pulled off her car and rushed to her cabin. Putting on the PPE kit, she spent a minute in front of the idol of Krishna placed on her table and with a deep sigh raced towards the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She reminded herself, the struggle was not over yet. She had to constantly fight with her demons within and the demon outside conspiring to bring the whole of humanity to a standstill, as Sumi perceived. Medically termed as Covid 19, this virus was not just physically ailing humans, but also took a great toll on mental health. She thus determined to rest only when the whole world is victorious in this battle against the brutal pandemic. She understood the strive was tough yet not impossible. However, only constant endeavour from everyone could bring an end to the dreaded pandemic. Her motivation from successfully treating 18 patients and sending them back home, well, made her realise how important her own mental strength was. At a time when everyone looks up to the doctors with hope and belief, Sumi affirmed herself that she couldn't lose her strength. It was not only her mere responsibility to treat, but also a stand of humanity to instil hope among the sufferers. She promised herself not to let her agonies work as a blockade towards bettering the condition. Rather, her agonies along with her skills must now be vested in progress; progress towards the cause of the whole of India’s fight against the deadly pandemic.</p>

    title: 'The Dumpster Girl',
    category: 'Story',
    description: <div class="container" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}><p>My name is Tori Morgenstern. And this is my incidents story.<br></br><br></br>

    So, yes as I already mentioned my name and I turn 17 this year. I study in St. Peter’s High School. I am a straight studious A1 student . I wear spectacles. I have won many quiz competitions, Olympiads etc. I like to engage with studies and I am quite sincere towards it. I don’t like to party, involved in gatherings and get-togethers , wear expensive fashionable clothes and do dozens of makeup to stand out confidentially. On weekends I like to spend my time peacefully in my room studying or in the library. OK!! So you got a rough picture about me. You may be thinking I am a complete geek or nerd and you are right. But, is it a crime to be a geek or nerd?? I asked you because my fellow mates think that it is a horrible crime. They called me ‘nerdy Tom’. They hate me because I don’t match with them. My social status is in negative, as I hardy use any. In short yes I don’t have friends. I am the school’s punching bag for them. I have been bullied and mentally harassed for last eleven years here. Not a single day passes when I am not bullied and harassed.<br></br><br></br>
    
    You must be thinking why I am even in this school or why I don’t tell my parents about this. You are right to think that. I even thought about it. But it will be worthless, because my talent of being suffer through this kind of situations is not limited to my school only but the whole city and the neighborhood does it to me. And as far complaining I already did that. My parents went to the principal , she suspended the students for two weeks. I was very happy, but after they came back I faced their wrath. They punched me, kicked me and said something that mentally disturbed me a lot. I learnt a lesson thinking of not getting into such worse situation and never complained again in my life.<br></br><br></br>
    
    I nicknamed my bullies as ‘Bulldozers’ just like bulldozers demolish everything they also demolished every part of me.<br></br><br></br>
    
    Once they threw a bucket of paint mixed with rotten eggs. I was now named as ‘Smelly Smurf'. Then in another day, they threw me away in a dumpster because I won every Track event (yes running away from my bulldozers every single day of my life I developed tremendous speed). After I escaped from dumpster, I smelled like rotten garbage for few days. No amount of scrubbing and perfumes could take away that horrible smell from me As expected from then they named me as ‘The Dumpster Girl’.<br></br><br></br>
    
    I don’t even know till now that what’s wrong with me and why that they hate me so much. But deep down the inner me always answered me to this questions that I am a lot better then them. They can never be like me in every way I am therefore they hate me. But I didn’t listen to my inner voice. I am really flattered! I am calm as well as dump to be going through all this and letting them harm me.<br></br><br></br>
    
    But everything was about to change. It was a Friday, I was returning home from school. When suddenly a group of 10 boys surrounded me. I was the only one helpless girl there and prayed to God to give me strength and took two steps for escape. Then one of them came in front of me and said “Hey! Dumpster, where are you going?”. I replied “I am going to a place called home, bulldozer”. He shouted at me and said “ mind your language dumpster”. I again answered him “why don’t you all people mind your head and go back home? “. That must have pissed him as he slapped me hard in my face and came very near to me with some bad intentions. It was enough for me, I can’t tolerate this harassments more and thought of ending this so I fight back. I don’t know at that point what happened to me as I never fight back to such situations before but this time I lift my hands on someone for rescue. I punched him hard and blood came out from his nose. On queue all boys came to attack me. I fought back as much as I could valiantly. But seriously I was easily outnumbered and felt numb when one of them hold and hit me hard towards a wall. I felt dizzy. I could hear some sounds of sirens and see some blurry cops catching the boys.<br></br><br></br>
    
    I recalled one of my fellowmate said to me “ I don’t know why Tori I hate you or the school hate and bullies you, I think they also don’t know. It’s just a sort of entertainment for them and you are an easy target for it”. That hit me today. They hated me, bullied me, harassed me just because Tori Morgenstern is a nerd and I was an easy target for their sort of entertainment.<br></br><br></br>
    
    Now I am in the hospital bed and my breathing slowing down. I knew my time was coming. But I am happy because I went down fighting. My life was a hell on earth. I never witnessed any miracle but I am happy because despite the hard and painful life I went through I never considered of taking my life away and quitting. Today I feel like a huge burden has been lifted up from my body. And then I saw only darkness but inside I was swept away by a flood of bright and warm light. I can’t breath anymore but my last breath was a relief.<br></br><br></br>
    
    I just wish that my story inspires others not to be like me to be in case of getting bullied or harassed instead speak out and fight. Also don’t give up on life if you are having hard time to survive.<br></br><br></br>
    
    And please don’t bully or harassed others mentally or physically because you now know it hurts and it’s hurts too much. Bullying is perhaps the worst form of crime as well as sexual harassments. Not only that harass the person physically but mentally too. Breaking the person from inside. It is a set back for the person’s life, it’s family as well as to the society.<br></br><br></br>
    
    Tori was a brilliant and talented student. She could have contributed a lot to her family and to the society. But her right to life was snatched away from her by the bulldozers. We talk greatly about Human Rights but do we really follow it ? When someone bullies you don’t be silent, fbe brave and fight back. Don’t be a silent observer too. When you watch others harassing and bullying others stop them. Because Dante said “ The darkest places in Hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality at the time of Moral Crises”.</p></div>,

      <p>Shining through the windows of dew drops on the leaves and birds chirping in and around marks the fragrance of Ravi. Ravi: The Banyan tree isn't just a religious tree for devotees but also, a part of our extended family and our hearts. Ravi has been sown by Anni; my grandmother, two decades ago. Anni's soft hands would nurture Ravi everyday along with an exchange of serene conversation of love.<br></br><br></br>

As seasons flied by; Ravi grew-up into a toddler, and so did Gauri; Gauri my sister. Every morning I woke-up to see the trio: Ravi, Anni and Gauri playing and giggling together. Anni would make a swing out of the ropes and tie it untill the tallest branches of Ravi. There were times even, when Anni made Gauri crawl till the highest top of Ravi. Ravi, in fact is a home of hundreds of birds and all I saw how every evening Anni and Gauri would rejoice together to the mesmerizing sight of the beautiful birds resting on the branches of Ravi.<br></br><br></br>

Ravi acted as an umbrella of shade, safeguarding people from the scorching rays of the Sun. Children all around from the neighborhood would play under Ravi only to discover that, there were stairs beneath the ground. Fascinatingly, no one knew the mystery of those stairs and it felt veracious to let the unsolved mystery, undiscovered.<br></br><br></br>

Now, whenever I'm cold and numb, I turn back to relish the tales of Ravi, Anni and Gauri; sometimes I feel that twenty long years has gone within a blink of an eye. Gauri has grown-up and isn't my little Gauri anymore. More saddening is that, even Anni has gone faraway from us but all I could feel her is in between Ravi's arms.<br></br><br></br>

Now, whenever nostalgia strikes me I find myself beneath Ravi. A single touch of Ravi makes me alive and relishes the loving memories of Anni and Gauri, leaving behind a bittersweet curve in my heart, left to be imprinted forever.

    title: 'The mechanics of desire',
    category: 'Blog',
    description: <div class="container" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}><p>Do you dream? Everyone does…isn’t it?<br></br><br></br>

    But I am not talking about those dreams that you dreamt during your sleep. Those are just memory revisions of your brain. I am talking about your desires! Yes, in a real sense dream is nothing but a desire. You desire to be an actor, to be a doctor, to be a topper in the class, to be a scientist, to be a rich countryman, to be a famous entrepreneur…endlessly it goes on! It is the desire that makes you do all the activities of life. But how? Okay…let me ask you a question! What makes you read this article right now? What makes you get up from the bed and brush your teeth? What makes you eat your breakfast? What makes you go to your workplace? (your job). It’s all your desire that makes you alive. Yes! desire is life. Without desire, you cannot do a thing. Alright, we understand that. Now let me ask you one more question! What is the root cause of all the suffering in human beings? The answer is very simple. It is the Unfulfilled Desires that lies within you. The damn life is not happening the way you want it to be!<br></br><br></br>

    Desire is life but it is the source of all your miseries! Let’s say, you seen someone who desired to be a doctor but was unable to do and committed suicide as a result of his frustration, or someone who had great ambition and worked hard to become an IAS officer or gain admission to a prestigious university but was unable to accomplish their goal and end their life because they couldn’t handle distress. These incidents occur around us, sometimes daily. Isn't it true that the root cause of these unfortunate incidents is unfulfilled desire?<br></br><br></br>
    
    Have you ever given a thought to about why we desire? If you see life with necessary awareness you will notice that the very process of life is seeking in nature. It is seeking for something, a certain urge to include, evolve and grow to its ultimate nature. When you analyze your most basic desires such as prosperity, fame, traveling, sexuality, shopping, knowledge, or love, you will notice that the underlying urge is to include something or someone into yourself. Fundamentally, you want to expand your way of being, and it will not going to settle for any amount of expansion. There is a part of you that longs for a boundless experience. It occurs in all aspects of life. For example, take a look at the lives of plants. When you sow a seed, it grows into a sapling,then a plant, and finally a tree. It continues to rise. Would it have been grown upwards if it didn't have the boundlessness?<br></br><br></br>
    
    But why this boundlessness or limitlessness? Because the life you are is infinite or limitless. But the problem is, it is identified with this limited physical body. This infinite life cannot be confined in its limited body therefore, it thirst for more and that is what we call a desire. Take a look at the world's billionaires! Isn't it true that they aspire to be a bit richer every day than they were yesterday? Desire finds different physical expressions. Remember that desire is not for more, it is for “all”. When this craving for oneness or the desire to embrace everything as a part of yourself manifests as a basic physical expression, we can call it sex. When it comes to sex, you're frantically seeking to unite with someone. It doesn't happen how hard you try. Yes, you may believe for a time that you have become one with another person, but you realize that everything is separate. When you try this mentally, it is usually described as avarice, conquest, or ambition. You desire to conquer the world by incorporating everything as a part of yourself. If this finds an emotional expression, we call it love. We call it yoga, when it finds conscious expression. YOGA means union. The whole game is about whether, your desire finds a conscious expression or an unconscious expression. When your desire finds a conscious expression, it makes your life beautiful and finding an unconscious expression, it makes your life ugly.<br></br><br></br>
    
    You want more and more, and because of your wrong identification with your body, you have forgotten that you are infinite in reality. That doesn't mean you don't accomplish anything in life and just say to yourself, "I am infinite! I am infinite!” No, don’t do this. Do everything that you want to do but you just need to desire consciously. If you have a conscious desire, such as"I want to be a good doctor so that I may provide a social contribution to humanity. I will put forth the necessary effort to achieve my goal. And if I don't achieve my goal, that's just fine; I'll do something else to help humanity” . When you become a little conscious, suddenly you can feel the profundity of your life.<br></br><br></br>

    Sadhguru, once said something like this: “When Patanjali wrote the yogasutras, he began them in a unique manner, The first chapter of the yogasutras begins with ‘...and now, yoga’—a half-sentence. A great life document begins with a half-sentence. It makes no sense intellectually, but what it means experientially is: "If you still feel that buying a new house, finding a new wife, or getting your daughter married will settle your life, it is not yet time for yoga."<br></br><br></br>

But, if you've seen money, power, wealth, and pleasure, if you've tasted everything in your life, and you've realized that nothing is going to work in the genuine sense and eventually please you, it's time for yoga.”</span><br></br><br></br>

<span style={{fontWeight:'500'}}>Yoga is the ultimate tool to raise the human consciousness. Do yoga, be conscious, and experience the profundity of life.</span></p></div>,

    Thus, engendering to you, no harm.<br></br><br></br>

    Power-packed fruits for the breakfast,<br></br>
    With slices of bread, two or three;<br></br>
    A glass of juice and a hard boiled egg,<br></br>
    How appetizing it sounds, don't you see?!<br></br><br></br>

    A quarter plate, full of whole grains,<br></br>
    A quarter, inherent of fresh green;<br></br>
    Plenty of daal into a bowl,<br></br>
    Can complete your lunch routine!<br></br><br></br>
    
    The more the salads you have,<br></br>
    The more the nutrients you acquire;<br></br>
    A poultry meat or a fish curry, to boot,<br></br>
    Escalates your alimentative, you require.<br></br><br></br>

    With veggies and vitamin-rich food;<br></br>
    A glass of milk could probably,for the supper,<br></br>

    'Skipping meals' is not a good option,<br></br>
    Causing you later, to crave for junks;<br></br>

    With a mouth-full of yummy chunks.<br></br><br></br>

    Exercise brings to you positivity and energy,<br></br>
    A sound sleep brings you overall wit;<br></br>
