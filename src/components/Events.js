      <p style={{color: 'white',textAlign: 'justify'}}>You have often heard the quote, ”Sharing is Caring”, but do you practice this in real life? If not then you are missing out on the most significant feeling in life. The satisfaction you receive after bringing a smile to someone’s face is very unreal yet very special.
<br></br>
Wake With Wellness got lucky on this note. We had the opportunity to conduct a drive called ”Wellness Drive- Clothes and Books Donation Drive” at Dhemaji. We collected books and clothes from the locals and arranged them accordingly for the drive.
<br></br>
On 20th February 2022, the collected items were distributed among the children at Enjori Children's Home, an orphanage in Borajan, Machkhowa, Dhemaji. The innocent smiles of the children made us realize that we’ve got a great life with all the necessary materials available to us and yet we tend to take things for granted. 
<br></br>
This event surely inspired us and hope that it did to you too. Come forward and experience the joy of SHARING.

      <p style={{color: 'white',textAlign: 'justify'}}>There is no denying the fact that unscientific and inaccurate information about menstruation is rife in many parts of India. Millions of girls and women still don't have adequate knowledge regarding the reproductive tract infections caused due to ignorance of personal hygiene during menstruation.<br></br>
In this regard, team WakeWithWellness has successfully organised the Awareness session "Prabhati/প্ৰভাতী/प्रभाती - The Dawn Of A Vital Outlook" which target girls in their early teens.
The entire fraternity had amazing sessions and friendly talks with the students. We tried to cover the most critical aspects of the subject matter from best of our knowledge like: the signs of first periods, all about menstrual cycle, the importance, do's and don'ts, when to consult a doctor, hygiene, different methods used during periods, home remidies, stereotypes and myths.</p>
